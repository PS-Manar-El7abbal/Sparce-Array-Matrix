# Sparse Array and Matrix Project

Welcome to the **Sparse Array and Matrix** project! 🎉

This project is part of the course **"Mastering Critical Thinking in Data Structures Using C++"** by **Dr. Moustafa Saad**. The focus of this project is on implementing efficient data structures using **C++**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Objective:** To create an efficient representation of sparse arrays and matrices.
- **Data Structure Used:** Double Linked List
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Efficient storage for sparse data.
  - Optimized traversal and manipulation using linked lists.

## 💻 Why This Project is Interesting
- It demonstrates how to handle large datasets with minimal memory usage.
- It leverages the power of **double linked lists** for efficient insertions and deletions.
- It's an excellent example of applying critical thinking in data structures.

## 📂 Explore the Code
